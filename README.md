# USB Arcade two player controller with spinner
## Introduction
Firmware for the Arcade two player controller with spinner built by [Antonio Villena](https://www.antoniovillena.es/).

As it is based on MickGyver's work, the input lag for this adapter is also minimal.

## Building the projects
You will need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to build the project. Download the repository via the "Clone or download" button, open the project (.ino extension) in the IDE and select "Arduino Leonardo" in Tools / Board. Connect the Arduino to a USB port and build/upload from Scetch / Upload.

You have to install the great [YetAnotherArduinoPcIntLibrary](https://github.com/paulo-raca/YetAnotherArduinoPcIntLibrary) for the management of PCINT.

## Credits
The great work by MickGyver and his [DaemonBite-Arcade-Encoder](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Arcade-Encoder), from where I took the code for the base and two player arcade adapter.

Also, the great work by Niels3RT and his [SpinJoy - Spinner and Joystick combo](https://github.com/Niels3RT/SpinJoy), from where I took the code for the spinner.

And last but not least, thanks to [Antonio Villena](https://www.antoniovillena.es/) for the ideas and prompts.
